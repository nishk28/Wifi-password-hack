# These are system packages that should be installed via apt
# The core functionality depends on the aircrack-ng suite

# python3 (3.6+)

# Optional packages for extended functionality:
# hashcat (for GPU acceleration)
# pyrit (deprecated but sometimes useful)
# cowpatty (WPA/WPA2 dictionary attacks)
